# Visual Studio Theme Files

These are the new JSON format for VS 2017. I got a lot of them from someone else on GitHub but I couldn't find them again 
so I figured I would spread the love. I've created a few themes myself and if you would like to add some to this collection 
please feel free to reach out

## TO AVOID CONFUSION ##

I've seen more than a few people not realize this is completely new format. 

+ Visual Studio 2017 Only
+ Files are in JSON format (NO XML!!!)
+ File extension is .vstheme (not .vssettings)
+ Files are generated by the new VS 2017 Theme Builder
