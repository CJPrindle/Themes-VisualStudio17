# New Visual Studio Theme File Format

These files are in the new JSON format - _.vstheme_ - which first appeared Visual Studio 2017.
I downloaded many from someone on GitHub but I was unable find them again -- _thank you, anonymous Theme Maker_ -- so I figured I would spread the love of these cool themes. I've created a few of them myself and I urge you to add your own to this collection. It would be great to amass a huge selection for everyone to enjoy.

## TO AVOID CONFUSION ##
Many don't know this is a new theme format from Microsoft. 

- Visual Studio 2017 and Up
- Files are in JSON format (NO XML!!!)
- File extension is .vstheme - _not .vssettings_
- Files are generated by the new Visual Studio Theme Editor
