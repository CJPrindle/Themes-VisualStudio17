# Visual Studio Theme Files

These files are written in the new JSON format for VS 2017 only. I downloaded lot of these from someone else on GitHub but I could never find them again so I figured I would spread the love of cool themes. I've created a few themes myself and if you would like to add some to this collection please feel free to reach out. It would be great to have a huge selection for people.

## TO AVOID CONFUSION ##

I've seen more than a few people not realize this is a completely new format. 

+ Visual Studio 2017 Only
+ Files are in JSON format (NO XML!!!)
+ File extension is .vstheme (not .vssettings)
+ Files are generated by the new VS 2017 Theme Builder
